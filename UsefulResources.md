# Useful resources, links, and materials for the course

## Open-source data and resources

- Our World in Data website. This one is used quite heavily in the course (and it is my personal favorite, for various topics, not only growth-related): [Economic Growth - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth) (to browse topics, got to "Articles by Topic" at the top of the website. You can also download actual data used there, and browse sources (i.e., where is the data coming from)
- From David Weil (Brown University Professor): [Economic Growth](https://routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9780321795731/weblinks.php) - resources on Growth, including datasets, collections by other authors, etc.
- Gapminder Resources | [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/resources/), see e.g., stuff on GDP per capita: [GD001 | Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd001/)

## Online (free) lectures/courses on growth and related topics

- Core Econ CORE - [Economics for a changing world](https://www.core-econ.org/) is a fascinating collection of lectures and examples on various topics (including Intro to Econ + lots of interesting topics among those that we cover in this course, check Units 2 and 16 here The Economy: [Contents (core-econ.org)](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/0-3-contents.html)). They also do amazing stuff, like, how to visualize income inequality within and between countries using data on skyscrapers: Skyscrapers: Visualizing global income inequality - CORE (core-econ.org) (Links to an external site.), and so much more.
- Marginal Revolution University (MRU)
  - Especially for those lacking some of the basic prep. in economics, I suggest you take a look at the course in Macroeconomics at the MRU website: [Macroeconomics, MRU](https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0) (topics 1, 2, and 3 are especially useful for you). 
  - Marginal Revolution University course on Development Economics is also a very good companion to this course: [Development Economics, MRU](https://mru.org/development-economics). You will find many topics we cover discussed there by amazing Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen (both are professors at the George Mason University)
