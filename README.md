# Introduction to Economic Growth 

This course was taught in July and August 2021 as part of Brown University [Summer School](https://precollege.brown.edu/programs/summerbrown) - program at Brown targeted at
very motivated and talanted High School and Rising College students. The course was delivered online, mostly via Canvas web platform, and was asynchronous - meaning that lectures
and math sections were pre-recorded. Content was delivered in a very intense, short-course format, over a 4 weeks period, with strict due dates for quizzes, discussions, problem
sets, and the final exam. The course was designed to be college-level difficulty, taken after introductory economics course, and requires good command of high school algebra,
but no advanced calculus or statistics.

No textbook is required for the course. However, "Economic Growth" by David Weil (3rd edition, Routledge) is a great 'companion' textbook that complements many of the lectures
and topics covered in the course.

According to the rules of Brown University, I can not share video lectures from the course. However, I can share the syllabus, lecture slides, assignments, and other course content. All these materials can be found in corresponding folders within the main repository.
